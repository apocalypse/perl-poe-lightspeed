=head1 ABSTRACT

	This module aims to connect POE kernels into a network, a "botnet" of sorts.

	Furthermore, the venerable IKC is now under design & development towards IKC2.
	Think of this module as a playground for IKC2 ideas, so don't do any serious development around this unless I tell you it's ok!

=head1 DESCRIPTION

In the Lightspeed world, you have either a server or a client. Obviously, the clients connect to servers. In order
for server kernels to connect to other kernels, you can run a client and a server session in the same process.

Please familiarize yourself with the concepts of IKC, especially it's "destination specifier" stuff.

The big difference between Lightspeed and IKC is that a lot of the bookkeeping stuff has been automated. You no longer
have to publish sessions, nor register for remote sessions. Sending messages is a snap, using the normal $_[KERNEL]->post()
interface everyone is accustomed to, instead of sending to a session to do the work.

Lightspeed goes a step beyond IKC, it does not create "proxy" sessions to relay data back to the remote kernel. Instead, it hacks
into POE::Kernel, POE::Session, and POE::Resource::Events to get them to recognize the destination specifiers and act upon them.

=head2 DESTINATION SPECIFIER

The IKC destination specifier has been expanded a little, now you can send to multiple kernels/sessions at the same time.

	'poe://kernel1,kernel2/session1,session2/state'

Furthermore, the special character '*' signifies "broadcast"

	'poe://*/session1/state'	->	Every kernel in the network ( excludes the current kernel )
	'poe://kernel1/*/state'		-> 	Every session in kernel1 with an alias
	'poe://kernel1/session1/*'	->	Just posts to the state named '*', nothing special here
	'poe://*/*/state'		->	A whole lot of fun!

Also, it's possible to pass the specifier as an arrayref or hashref

ARRAYREF:

	[ kernel, session, state ]

HASHREF:

	{
		'KERNEL'	=>	kernel,
		'SESSION'	=>	session,
		'STATE'		=>	state,
	}

=head2 POST

To post to a remote kernel, there are a few formats allowed.

	$kernel->post( 'poe://kernel/session/state', @args );	# The "Lightspeed" way to do it
	$kernel->post( $_[SENDER], 'state', @args );		# Will work nicely too
	$kernel->post( $_[SENDER]->ID, 'state', @args );	# Ditto
	$kernel->post( [ qw( kernel session state ) ], @args );	# Alternate method of supplying the specifier
	$kernel->post( $_[SENDER], $_[CALLER_STATE], @args )	# Yes, Lightspeed supplies this information too!

These ways will fail horrendously:

	$kernel->post( $_[SENDER], @args );			# No, Lightspeed will not automatically send it back to the originating kernel/session/state!
	$kernel->post( $_[SENDER]->ID, @args );			# Ditto.
	$kernel->post( $_[SENDER]->ID . 'state', @args );	# This will fail if $_[SENDER] is not a remote kernel, but WILL WORK!

=head2 CALL

The concept of a call() cannot be really applied to remote kernels, so you have to supply a "RSVP" destination, the place where
the resulting data from the call() should go.

To call a remote kernel, there are a few formats allowed.

	$kernel->call( 'poe://kernel/session/state', 'poe://kernel/session/state', @args );	# The "Lightspeed" way to do it
	$kernel->call( $_[SENDER], 'state', 'poe://kernel/session/state', @args );		# Will work nicely too
	$kernel->call( $_[SENDER]->ID, 'state', 'poe://kernel/session/state', @args );		# Ditto
	$kernel->call( $_[SENDER], 'state', [ qw( kernel session state ) ], @args );		# Alternate method of supplying the specifier
	$kernel->call( $_[SENDER], $_[CALLER_STATE], 'poe://kernel/session/state', @args );	# Yes, Lightspeed supplies this information too!

These ways will fail horrendously:

	$kernel->call( 'poe://kernel/session/state', @args );					# No RSVP specifier here!
	$kernel->call( $_[SENDER], 'poe://kernel/session/state', @args );			# No remote state!
	$kernel->call( $_[SENDER]->ID . 'state', 'poe://kernel/session/state', @args );		# This will fail if $_[SENDER] is not a remote kernel, but WILL WORK!

=head2 Lightspeed Extras

Being super-friendly as it is, Lightspeed gives the programmer a few extras to make their life easier!

	The predefined event fields will give you the correct information:
		- SENDER
		- CALLER_STATE
		- CALLER_FILE
		- CALLER_LINE

	A few methods has been added to POE::Session ( $_[SENDER] )
		- is_lightspeed
			It returns true if the calling session is on a remote kernel, false otherwise

		These methods are valid only if is_lightspeed() returns true:
			- remote_kernel
				Returns the name of the remote kernel

			- remote_session
				Returns the name of the remote session

			- remote_state
				Returns the name of the remote state

			- remote_file
				Returns the filename that initiated this request

			- remote_line
				Returns the line number that initiated this request

	The $session->ID method returns the following string. This can be used freely as a session specifier, but you still
	have to supply the state. So, it's very possible to do stuff like $_[SENDER]->ID . 'state' and get the right specifier
	to supply.
		'poe://kernel/session/'

	Lightspeed checks the POE Version and matches the appropriate hackery, so if you have an unsupported version
	of POE, it won't work because I don't want to totally screw up POE by using the wrong data. If there's a reason you
	absolutely must have support for POE version X, let me know and I can hack it up.

	Postbacks/Callbacks work properly with $_[SENDER], even when it is a remote kernel :)

=head1 GOTCHAS

	- If you're using a subclass of POE::Session that does not inherit from POE::Session, the lightspeed hackery won't work!

	- The versions of the serializer on both the client/server MUST be the same, Storable is very picky about this!

	- A client cannot connect to a server in the same process

	- Every kernel name in the network must be unique, the default POE::Kernel->ID is useful for this

	- This is not a spanning tree network, that means a cyclic network is allowed. This is the opposite of IRC networks.
		Spanning Tree:
			A - B - D
			    |
			    C

		Cyclic network:
			     /------\
			A - B - C - D
			 \------/

	- Unlike IKC, there is no need to "publish" sessions

	- You post events through the POE::Kernel instance, not to a special session
		$_[KERNEL]->post( 'poe://blah/blah/blah', @args );

	- The characters '*', '/', and ',' is not allowed in kernel names and session aliases

	- Keep in mind, when you are sending objects, that the appropriate modules are loaded in both the sender + receiver

=head1 KNOWN BUGS / TODO LIST

	- Having 2 clients connecting at the same time causes the routing system to go snafu :(

	- Argument parsing isn't as strict as it should be, and funky things will be allowed, like:
		$_[KERNEL]->post( 'poe://kernel1,kernel2,*/session1,session2,*/blah', @args );

	- As of now, Lightspeed will silently drop messages destined towards unknown kernels/sessions

	- Addition of a "monitor" system where you register for callbacks whenever specific things happen:
		- Client connect/disconnect
		- Messages leaving/arriving their destinations
		- General debugging junk

	- Adding the local ip/port to bind to for clients

	- Creating the ClientLite module, similar to the one found in IKC

	- Would be nice for the Lightspeed router to "weigh" specific links and adjust priority to accomodate lag/load

	- More documentation!
